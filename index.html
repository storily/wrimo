        <h1>Writing<br />Month</h1>
        <p>
            Writing Month (WriMo) is a journey to write a story. From
            first-timers to award-winning authors, join a community of creative
            minds all around the world. There's no prescribed genre, no theme,
            no plot but your own, no harsh reviewers, no grammar police, no
            grades. It's only you, the page, and us: the friends you'll make
            along the way. Every&nbsp;November, write 50,000 words in
            30&nbsp;days.
        </p>

        <h2>How to participate</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Find your local community.</strong> Writing is more fun
                when there's other people to share the times with. A favoured
                activity is a Write-In, an in-person (or virtual) event where a
                group of people meet socially to write, talk, and hang out
                together. Communities will also have a trove of resources to
                help you write and dream, and once November is over, to help you
                edit and, if you wish, publish.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Get an idea.</strong> Whether you're a
                <em>plotter</em> (someone who likes to meticulously plan their
                story) or a <em>pantser</em> (someone who writes "by the seat of
                their pants", without a plan) or something in between, to start
                with you'll need an idea of something to write. Any genre is
                good, including non-fiction, fan-fiction, and more. Make up
                chracters, find a setting, and get ready to write the story
                you've always wanted to read.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Pick a goal.</strong> 50,000 words is the traditional
                number. It's the length of an average-sized novel. But there's
                no real rules here: you can choose a smaller or larger number,
                or even change your mind midway. 15,000 is completely doable for
                the busiest of professionals, and some prolific writers are
                known to write over 200,000 words in the month. If you write
                long-hand or on a typewriter, you may choose to instead reach a
                number of pages. The guideline is 450 words per page: 50,000
                words makes for about 110 pages.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Track your words.</strong> We recommend
                <a href="https://trackbear.app/">TrackBear</a> to record your
                progress and share it and even compete on leaderboards. Your
                local community may have a private leaderboard for the event, or
                other recommendations. You can also track your wordcount in your
                writing software, a spreadsheet, or good old paper. To achieve
                50,000 words in 30&nbsp;days, you'll need to write 1,667 words
                per day. It's a good idea to track not only your total, but also
                how you've done per day, so you can tell if you need to speed up
                or can relax for a while.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Write!</strong> Starting November 1st, write! Writing
                every day is a good habit, but it's entirely okay to take breaks
                or make your own schedule. The general advice is
                <em>Don't Edit</em>. You can leave spelling mistakes and grammar
                mishaps where they are. Characters with placeholder names are
                totally okay. Don't know the name of the country your
                star-crossed lovers are fleeing to?
                <code>TK Countryname</code> is your friend (<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_come_(publishing)"
                    >TK is a copywriting convention</a
                >
                for marking placeholders). If you need to delete a sentence or
                paragraph, cross it out or set its colour to white instead of
                erasing it, so it's still counted. The goal is to write 50,000
                words, not have 50,000 usable words at the end of the month.
                There's always editing.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sprint!</strong> "Word wars" or "Word sprints" are short
                timed events, often organised in a community. It's also a great
                way to focus or challenge yourself to write. In a sprint, you
                set a timer (typically for 20 minutes) and write as much as you
                can before time runs out. Many Writing Months are made up
                entirely of sprints, writing a few hundred words at a time and
                then taking a break. You may also know of the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique"
                    >Pomodoro</a
                >
                technique: sprints are like that, but with others.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>November 30th: You're Done!</strong> Take a break! Then
                you can edit your book (if you want) and yes, even get it
                published (or self-publish), or put it all on the internet, or
                leave it at the bottom of a drawer ne'er to see the light of day
                again. What matters is you've done it! Brag about it, have a
                rest and relax, and come back next November to do it all again.
            </li>
